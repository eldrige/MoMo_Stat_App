## Project Title: SMS Data Processing Application

### Overview

This project is a full-stack application designed to process, analyze, and visualize SMS data from MTN MoMo, a prominent Mobile Payment Service Provider in Rwanda. The application will handle XML data, perform data cleaning and categorization, store the data in a relational database, and provide a frontend interface for data visualization.

### Objectives

- **Process SMS Data**: Read and parse the provided XML file containing approximately 1600 SMS messages.
- **Clean and Categorize Data**: Implement data cleaning techniques to ensure data integrity and categorize messages based on their type.
- **Database Management**: Store the processed SMS data in a relational database for efficient querying and analysis.
- **Frontend Development**: Build an interactive dashboard to visualize insights derived from the SMS data, allowing for easy analysis.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**:

  - Node.js / Python (Flask/Django) for server-side logic
  - XML parsing libraries (e.g., `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python or `xml2js` in Node.js)
  - SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

- **Frontend**:
  - React / Angular / Vue.js for creating the user interface
  - Charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) for data visualization

### Steps to Complete the Assignment

1. **Setup Development Environment**:

   - Install necessary software (Node.js/Python, database server).
   - Set up a version control system (Git).

2. **XML Data Processing**:

   - Load the XML file using appropriate libraries.
   - Parse the XML to extract relevant information from SMS messages.

3. **Data Cleaning and Categorization**:

   - Implement functions to clean the data (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values).
   - Categorize messages into predefined types for easier analysis.

4. **Database Setup**:

   - Design a relational database schema that accommodates the SMS data.
   - Create tables and relationships as needed.
   - Load cleaned data into the database.

5. **Frontend Development**:

   - Design the layout of the dashboard.
   - Implement interactive components for data visualization.
   - Connect the frontend to the backend API to fetch and display data.

6. **Testing**:

   - Conduct unit and integration tests to ensure the application functions as expected.
   - Validate data integrity and accuracy in the database.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
   - Ensure that the application is accessible to users.

### Expected Outcomes

By completing this assignment, you will have a fully functional enterprise-level full-stack application capable of processing and visualizing SMS data. You will gain experience in backend data processing, database management, and frontend development, showcasing your skills to potential stakeholders, including MTN.
